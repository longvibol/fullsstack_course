We want to user to view when they login then it will see the brand-list then they can 
Edit on the item and delete:

Ex:

1. Nokia ----------Edit | Deleted 

>> ng g c components/brand-form 
>> ng g c components/brand-list 

==> crate folder to keep them :

band : brand-list and brand-form 

------------------------------------------ Create routed (use parent and child route)

const routes: Routes = [
  {path:"user", component: UserComponent},
  {path:"brand", component:BrandComponent,
    children:[
      {path:"", redirectTo:"list",pathMatch:"full"},
      {path:"list", component:BrandListComponent},
      {path:"form", component: BrandFormComponent},
      {path:"form/:id",component:BrandFormComponent}
    ]
  }


-- Explain : 

1. Parent :

{path:"brand", component:BrandComponent, = when start page with localhost:4200/brand ==> it will redirect to parent main BrandComponent 

2. Childe rout 

{path:"", redirectTo:"list",pathMatch:"full"}, = localhost:4200/brand អត់ដាក់អីសោះ "" អោយវាទៅ brand-list 
 {path:"form", component: BrandFormComponent}, អោយវាទៅ brand-form 
 {path:"form/:id",component:BrandFormComponent} អោយវាទៅ brand-form ដូចគ្នា
